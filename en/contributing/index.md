Here are some pointers for anyone looking for mini-features and work items that would make a positive contribution to ReactiveUI.

* We keep [a bunch of curated tasks specifically for new contributors](https://github.com/reactiveui/reactiveui/labels/up-for-grabs), which are a great way to get started with open source and provide a fantastic avenue for getting to know the ReactiveUI maintainers.
* Write a blog post about `#ReactiveUI` and then [tweet the link to our twitter account](https://twitter.com/ReactiveXUI). We will retweet you.
* Contribute [a repro case](https://quaid.fedorapeople.org/TOS/Practical_Open_Source_Software_Exploration/html/sn-Debugging_the_Code-The_Anatomy_of_a_Good_Bug_Report.html) or [help resolve known issues](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues?q=is%3Aopen).
